  When the button is pressed, the user should be alerted 
  with a message saying "A button has been pressed"

<body>
  <h1>Click this button:</h1>
  <button id="test" onclick="">!!!!!</button>

  BONUS:
  If time permits, change the alert to a confirm statement,
  asking the user "Do you agree?", and add a <p> element 
  which will display the user's response to that question
